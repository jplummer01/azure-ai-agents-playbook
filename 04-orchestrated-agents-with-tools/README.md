## 🎯 Learning Path

We recommend following the tutorials in this order:

1. **Start with 04.1** - Master external API integration fundamentals
2. **Progress to 04.2** - Learn hybrid architectures combining multiple tool types
3. **Complete with 04.3** - Integrate cloud workflows with AI orchestration

**Prerequisites**: Complete the [01-agent-basics](../01-agent-basics/), [02-agent-custom-functions](../02-agent-custom-functions/), and [03-orchestrated-agents](../03-orchestrated-agents/) tutorials first.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, ensure you have:

### Previous Knowledge
- ✅ Completed all previous tutorial folders (01, 02, 03)
- ✅ Understanding of Azure AI Agents and custom functions
- ✅ Knowledge of agent orchestration patterns
- ✅ Familiarity with REST APIs and JSON

### Azure Resources
- ✅ Azure subscription with sufficient permissions
- ✅ Azure AI Foundry project
- ✅ Deployed AI model (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, etc.)
- ✅ Azure OpenAI resource (for Semantic Kernel scenarios)
- ✅ Azure Logic Apps (for workflow automation scenarios)

### Environment Setup
- ✅ Python 3.8+ installed
- ✅ Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with notebook support
- ✅ Azure CLI (recommended for authentication)
- ✅ Network access to external APIs (Frankfurter, etc.)


### Set up the Logic App on Azure

Please follow the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/logic-apps?pivots=portal) link. The final Logic App should look like this:

![logic-app](./images/logic-app.png)

When creating the trigger, please copy and paste the below in the "Request Body JSON Schema" field:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "to": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "subject": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "body": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

The trigger step should look like this:

![logic-app-trigger](./images/logic-app-trigger.png)


When creating the second step `Send an email (V2)`, please fill in the required fields as shown below:

![logic-app-send-email](./images/send-email.png)

The `to`, `subject`, and `body` fields will be available to populate from the previous step, which is the trigger. The `to` field will be used to send the email to the user, and the `subject` and `body` fields will be used to populate the email subject and body respectively. To add these fields, right-click on the "To*" field for example, then click on the blue lightning icon, and then select the proper value from the list of available fields. The final step should look like this:

![lightning](./images/lightning.png)

Please note that the `Send an email (V2)` action in the Logic App requires a valid email address to send notifications, and the user has to **manually** go through authentication in the Azure Portal when adding this Step to the workflow. You can use your own email address or create a test email account for this purpose.

The final details in the Jupyter notebook will look like this (or similar):

```python 
# Logic App details
logic_app_name = "agent-logic-apps" # Resource name of the Logic App in Azure
trigger_name = "When_a_HTTP_request_is_received" # Trigger name for the Logic App
```


### Environment Variables
Configure your Azure AI services by filling in the `.env` file at the project root level:

```bash
# Navigate to the project root and edit the .env file
cd ../../  # Go to azure-ai-agents-playbook root
# Edit .env file with your Azure AI configuration
```

The `.env` file should contain your Azure AI project details:
```properties
# Required for all tutorials
PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://your-foundry-resource.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/your-project-name"
MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="your-model-deployment-name"
