    "## 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **FastAPI Integration:**\n",
    "- FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI specifications\n",
    "- Azure AI Agents can consume any OpenAPI-compliant service\n",
    "- Local development services work seamlessly with cloud agents\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Dynamic API Discovery:**\n",
    "- Fetch OpenAPI specs from running services\n",
    "- No need to manually create API definitions\n",
    "- Agents automatically understand available endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Real-world Applications:**\n",
    "- Connect agents to internal business APIs\n",
    "- Integrate with existing microservices\n",
    "- Create conversational interfaces for data services\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "🔒 **Security**: Use proper authentication for production APIs\n",
    "📝 **Documentation**: Ensure OpenAPI specs have good descriptions\n",
    "⚡ **Performance**: Consider rate limiting and caching\n",
    "🧪 **Testing**: Always test both API endpoints and agent integration\n",
    "🔄 **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in both API and agent\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add authentication to your FastAPI service\n",
    "- Create more complex business logic APIs\n",
    "- Combine multiple microservices with one agent\n",
    "- Deploy both API and agents to production\n",
    "\n",
    "**Happy API integrating!** 🎉"
