      "The main differences between a **list** and a **tuple** in Python are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mutability**:\n",
      "   - **List**: Mutable (can be changed after creation: add, remove, or modify elements).\n",
      "   - **Tuple**: Immutable (cannot be changed after creation).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Syntax**:\n",
      "   - **List**: Defined with square brackets `[ ]`, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`\n",
      "   - **Tuple**: Defined with parentheses `( )`, e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Usage**:\n",
      "   - **List**: Used for collections of items that may need to change.\n",
      "   - **Tuple**: Used for fixed collections or when data shouldn't change (often for function returns or as dictionary keys).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Performance**:\n",
      "   - **Tuple**: Slightly faster than lists for iteration due to immutability.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**  \n",
      "Use a **list** for mutable sequences.  \n",
      "Use a **tuple** for immutable sequences.\n",

    "## 🎓 Congratulations! You're Now an Azure AI Agents Developer!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You've Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Core Concepts:**\n",
    "- What Azure AI Agents are and how they work\n",
    "- The relationship between agents, threads, messages, and runs\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Practical Skills:**\n",
    "- Setting up the Azure AI Agents client\n",
    "- Creating and configuring AI agents\n",
    "- Managing conversation threads\n",
    "- Sending messages and processing responses\n",
    "- Monitoring run status and handling results\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Development Approaches:**\n",
    "- **Step-by-step**: Full control over each operation\n",
    "- **Streamlined**: Convenience methods for common patterns\n",
    "- **Best practices**: Proper resource cleanup and error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand the basics, you can explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Calling**: Let your agents use tools and APIs\n",
    "2. **File Attachments**: Send images and documents to your agents\n",
    "3. **Streaming Responses**: Get real-time responses as they're generated\n",
    "4. **Advanced Threading**: Manage multiple ongoing conversations\n",
    "5. **Production Deployment**: Scale your agents for real applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agents are reusable**: Create once, use for multiple conversations\n",
    "- **Threads maintain context**: Each conversation remembers its history\n",
    "- **Runs process requests**: Always monitor run status for best results\n",
    "- **Cleanup matters**: Delete agents when you're done to manage costs\n",
    "\n",

    "- Insufficient quotas\n",
    "- Network connectivity problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timeout Issues\n",
    "**Problem**: Runs taking too long\n",
    "**Solution**: \n",
    "- Add timeout logic to your polling loops\n",
    "- Check your model's performance and quotas\n",
    "- Consider using shorter prompts for testing\n",
