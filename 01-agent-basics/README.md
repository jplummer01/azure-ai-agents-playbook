## 🎯 Learning Path

We recommend following the tutorials in this order:

1. **Start with 01.1** - Get familiar with the core Azure AI Agents concepts
2. **Explore 01.2** - Understand the enhanced capabilities with Semantic Kernel
3. **Master 01.3** - Learn proper resource management patterns

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, ensure you have:

### Azure Resources
- ✅ Azure subscription
- ✅ Azure AI Foundry project
- ✅ Deployed AI model (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, etc.)

### Environment Setup
- ✅ Python 3.8+ installed
- ✅ Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with notebook support
- ✅ Azure CLI (optional, for authentication)

### Environment Variables
Configure your Azure AI services by filling in the `.env` file at the project root level:

```bash
# Navigate to the project root and edit the .env file
cd ../../  # Go to azure-ai-agents-playbook root
# Edit .env file with your Azure AI configuration
```

The `.env` file should contain your Azure AI project details:
```properties
# Required for all tutorials
PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://your-foundry-resource.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/your-project-name"
MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="your-model-deployment-name"

# For Semantic Kernel scenarios
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-azure-openai-api-key"
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-openai-resource.openai.azure.com/"
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="your-chat-deployment"
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="your-deployment-name"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2024-12-01-preview"

# Optional: For advanced scenarios
REASONING_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="your-reasoning-model"
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="your-subscription-id"
```

💡 **Tip**: The `.env` file is already present in the project root with example values. Simply update it with your Azure AI project details.

### Required Packages
Each tutorial will install its required packages, but you can install them all upfront:

```bash
pip install azure-ai-agents azure-identity semantic-kernel
```

## 🔑 Key Concepts Covered

### 🤖 **Azure AI Agents**
