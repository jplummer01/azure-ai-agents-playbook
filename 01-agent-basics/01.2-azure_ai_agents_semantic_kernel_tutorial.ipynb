    "\n",
    "Think of Azure AI Agents with Semantic Kernel as your **AI-powered assistants** that can:\n",
    "- Have conversations with users\n",
    "- Remember what was discussed (through \"threads\")\n",
    "- Use plugins and tools to extend their capabilities\n",
    "- Maintain context across multiple interactions\n",
    "- Leverage the power of Semantic Kernel's orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts (Don't worry, we'll see these in action!):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent**: Your AI assistant powered by Azure AI and orchestrated by Semantic Kernel\n",
    "- **Thread**: A conversation session (like a chat conversation)\n",
    "- **Message**: Individual messages within a conversation\n",
    "- **Plugin**: Additional capabilities your agent can use (like calling APIs or processing data)\n",
    "- **Client**: The connection to Azure AI services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Semantic Kernel?\n",
    "- **Rich Plugin System**: Easily extend agent capabilities\n",
    "- **Async Support**: Better performance for real-world applications\n",
    "- **Enterprise Ready**: Built for production scenarios\n",
    "- **Cross-Platform**: Works across different platforms and languages\n",

    "### Authentication Problems\n",
    "**Error**: `DefaultAzureCredential failed to retrieve a token`\n",
    "**Solution**: \n",
    "- Make sure you're logged into Azure CLI: `az login`\n",
    "- Or set environment variables: `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`\n",
    "- For local development: `az login --use-device-code`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Configuration\n",
    "**Error**: `AzureAIAgentSettings configuration issues`\n",
    "**Solution**: \n",
    "- Verify your Azure OpenAI resource is properly deployed\n",
    "- Check model deployment name matches your Azure configuration\n",
    "- Ensure sufficient quota for your model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plugin Issues\n",
    "**Error**: `Plugin functions not being called`\n",
    "**Solution**: \n",
    "- Ensure proper `@kernel_function` decorators\n",
