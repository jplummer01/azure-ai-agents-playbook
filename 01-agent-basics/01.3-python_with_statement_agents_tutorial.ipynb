    "## 🧠 What is the Python `with` Statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement is Python's way of handling **context management**. Think of it as an automatic \"setup and cleanup\" mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 What happens with `with`:\n",
    "1. **Enter**: Resources are set up (connections opened, credentials loaded)\n",
    "2. **Work**: Your code runs inside the `with` block\n",
    "3. **Exit**: Resources are automatically cleaned up (connections closed, credentials disposed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Benefits:\n",
    "- **Automatic cleanup**: No need to remember to close connections\n",
    "- **Exception safety**: Cleanup happens even if errors occur\n",
    "- **Cleaner code**: Less boilerplate, more readable\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Perfect for:\n",
    "- Database connections\n",
    "- File operations\n",
    "- API clients (like Azure AI Agents!)\n",
    "- Any resource that needs cleanup\n",
    "\n",

    "## 🎯 When to Use `with` vs When NOT to Use It\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **USE `with` when:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Short-lived operations**: Single request-response interactions\n",
    "2. **Simple scripts**: One-off tasks or utilities\n",
    "3. **Clear boundaries**: When you know exactly when you're done with the client\n",
    "4. **Exception safety is critical**: When you want guaranteed cleanup\n",
    "5. **Following best practices**: Microsoft recommends this pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Perfect for 'with'\n",
    "with AgentsClient(...) as client:\n",
    "    agent = client.create_agent(...)\n",
    "    result = client.create_thread_and_process_run(...)\n",
    "    client.delete_agent(agent.id)\n",
    "# Automatic cleanup happens here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ **AVOID `with` when:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Long-lived applications**: Web servers, background services\n",
    "2. **Shared clients**: Multiple functions/classes need the same client\n",
    "3. **Custom lifecycle**: You need precise control over when cleanup happens\n",
    "4. **Performance critical**: Creating/destroying clients frequently is expensive\n",
    "5. **Complex state management**: When client lifetime doesn't match your scope\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Better without 'with' for long-lived apps\n",
    "class ChatService:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.client = AgentsClient(...)  # Lives for app lifetime\n",
    "        self.agent = self.client.create_agent(...)\n",

    "    \n",
    "    def shutdown(self):\n",
    "        self.client.close()  # Manual cleanup when app shuts down\n",

    "## 🏆 Best Practices Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Golden Rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Default to `with`**: Use it unless you have a specific reason not to\n",
    "2. **Match your pattern**: \n",
    "   - Script/utility → Use `with`\n",
    "   - Long-lived app → Manual management\n",
    "3. **Handle exceptions**: Always cleanup, even when errors occur\n",
    "4. **Async awareness**: Use `async with` for async code\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 **Quick Decision Guide:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself**: *\"Does my client lifetime match this code block?\"*\n",
    "- **Yes** → Use `with` ✅\n",
    "- **No** → Manual management ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **Performance Tips:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reuse clients** when possible (expensive to create)\n",
    "- **Use connection pooling** for high-throughput scenarios  \n",
    "- **Monitor resource usage** to catch leaks early\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Remember:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement isn't just about cleanup—it's about **writing more reliable, maintainable code**. When in doubt, use `with`! 🎉"
